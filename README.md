# Handwritten Digits Recognition
## Introduction:
This project builds a handwritten digit classifier using deep learning. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset (or a custom dataset) and predicts digits from 0-9. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in recognizing digits from scanned or drawn images.
## Dataset:
  • The dataset used for training is MNIST.
  • Training data: train.csv.
  • Test data: test.csv (if applicable).
## Project Description:
This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based handwritten digit recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained on a dataset of handwritten digits to accurately classify numbers from 0 to 9. The primary objective is to achieve high accuracy in recognizing digits from images, making it useful for applications such as digitized form processing, automated grading systems, and banking applications.

## Key Features:
 • Deep Learning Approach: Utilizes CNNs for high accuracy in image classification.
 • Dataset: Trained on the MNIST dataset or a custom dataset of handwritten digits.
 • Preprocessing: Image normalization and augmentation techniques to enhance model performance.
 • Model Evaluation: Achieves high accuracy with validation and test results.
 • Custom Predictions: Allows users to upload their own handwritten digit images for classification.

## Technologies Used:
• Python (NumPy, Pandas).
• TensorFlow/Keras for building the deep learning model.
• OpenCV for image processing.
• Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization.
• Jupyter Notebook for development and experimentation.
## Results:
Out of the 3 neural network models I have used in my project the best results are
• Training accuracy around 98%
• validation acuuracy around 96%
correct labels for the test dataset was not present but after manually checking above 90% images were correctly labeled.
